# Marine-Microplastics
This is an exploratory data analysis of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration's (NOAA) marine microplastics data to know and understand microplastics, their growth rate with respect to various ocean bodies in our planet earth. It involves data cleaning and EDA.

About Data: 
The NOAA NCEI global Marine Microplastics product provides access to aggregated, comprehensive, standardized, quality controlled, global data on microplastics in marine settings, from 1972-Present. The database contains information on microplastics concentrations (reported in particles/m3), date of collection, latitude and longitude where data was collected, sampling instruments used for collection, and links to publications on the data. The information in this database can be used to improve water quality and protect the ecosystem, especially coastal ecological habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests that help recycle nutrients, serve as breeding grounds for fingerlings, and permanent homes for oysters and other coastal marine wildlife.
